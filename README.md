#./wordgen [b]
#Generates b lines of random combination of characters. If b is not set or 0, wordgen generates infinite lines.
#./wordsearch
#Read each lines of stdin, match the line with a wordlist and output matched words. This program is intended to be slow, thus a simple for loop is used to compare strings.
#./pager
#Display 23 lines at a time. To display another 23 lines, press RETURN key. To quit the program, press q.
#./launcher [b]
#This program runs the three previous programs and output matched words a page at a time, which is 23 lines. The argument b is for ./wordgen

#Program pathes in launcher.c may need to change if files are places in different path.
